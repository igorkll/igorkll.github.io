`THE FUCKING PLYMOUTH DEVELOPERS WON'T SEE EMBEDDED!
there is keyboard processing in plymouth, and pressing esc brings up the console.
AND YOU CAN'T FUCKING TURN IT OFF!!
The developers of plymouth HATE EMBEDDED, where the OS should not handle CERTAIN keyboard shortcuts and SHOULD JUST RUN ONE APPLICATION!
now I will have to patch plymouth (I will post a modified version) in order to achieve the ideal embedded behavior on gnu/linux.
I beat windows in my winbox maker, and I'll beat linux in gnubox maker!
this stuff will never show up on my embedded devices,
I will make kernel and software patches to disable ABSOLUTELY ALL hotkeys and ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING that can come out on the screen except my application.`,

addCard('writing winbox maker recovery', 
`this will be in the next version of winbox maker 1.8.0
This will be the official recovery for winbox maker.
It is activated with a single button in the project and supports basic customization through winbox maker settings.
to run it in your project, it is enough to set one check mark during the build and then call from your application C:\\WinboxApi\\reboot_to_recovery.bat`,

`I'm doing nothing more than SAWING the SHIT OUT OF WINDOWS at the request of one person!
you have no idea how fucked up and overloaded this operating system is,
the list of disabled tasks in schtasks STUPIDLY DOES NOT FIT INTO THE DISCORD MESSAGE WITHOUT NITRO!
after removing all this crap, windows "suddenly" starts consuming 600 megabytes of RAM instead of 1.5-2 gigabytes, but it works fine.
I SINCERELY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MICROSOFT IS DOING THIS!!
FOR WHAT!! Why?? why so much junk? FOR WHAT!
it is impossible to use it, it interferes with computer operation.
after all, they see that with each windows update, the share of linux based systems on the desktop grows by ~ 1%, DON'T THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WILL KILL WINDOWS THIS WAY?
WHY microsoft, instead of SAWING OUT the SHIT, shove it even more. WHY, JUST FUCKING FOR WHAT!
windows won't start buying more from this, they won't get more money, THEY'LL JUST LOSE THEIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND LOSE 100% TO ANDROID IF GOOGLE MAKES THE OFFICIAL DESKTOP VERSION!
why can't they give you a choice: install shit (maximum compatibility with legacy software), DON'T INSTALL SHIT!
why DO I HAVE TO FINISH THEIR WORK FOR THEM!`,
