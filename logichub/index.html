                I'm logic on Discord, and BananaPen on steam!</br>
                on github, my nickname is igorkll. Historically, I have a lot of nicknames, I think it's too late to change anything.</br>
                My favorite game is ScrapMechanic! I can play it for hours on end, and I love making mods in this game.</br>
                I write code in languages such as: C, lua, C#, C++, python, bash</br>

                            SComputers is the best mod adding computers to Scrap Mechanic at the moment!<br/>
                            this mod originates from the ScriptableComputer mod, which is no longer supported by the developer<br/>
                            in fact, SComputers is an improved version of ScriptableComputer that has retained full compatibility with the original<br/>
                            the author of the original ScriptableComputer(TheFattestCat) doesn't mind that I'm doing a fork. and i got permission to create a fork
