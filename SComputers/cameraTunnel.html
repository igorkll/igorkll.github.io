            this component allows you to connect cameras via an antenna<br/>
            press E to set the channel. to work, make sure that the antenna frequencies and tunnel channel match<br/>
            make sure that the camera on the sending side is connected to the tunnel and the tunnel to the antenna<br/>
            make sure that the antenna on the receiving side is connected to the tunnel and the tunnel is connected to the computer<br/>
            this component completely borrows its API from the camera so that programs working with the camera can use this component<br/>
            despite the API being identical to the <a href="camera.html" class="hyper">camera</a>, this component has several methods of its own<br/>
            component name - camera<br/>
        </p>
