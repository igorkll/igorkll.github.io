        <p class="text">
            the SComputers mod has its own operating system called scriptableOS<br/>
            to run this operating system, you first need to import the BIOS from the mod examples into your computer<br/>
            then you need to import the operating system itself to the disk. to do this, press the E button on the disk, clear it and import scriptableOS
        </p>

        <br/>
        <h1>BIOS</h1>
        <h2>boot</h2>
        <p class="text">
            the BIOS works as follows: it first searches for the OS on all connected ROM disks, trying to interpret each one as an "image" type file system and then a "dump" type<br/>
            if this fails, it opens the rom disk as a table and if there is a string in the "init" key, it tries to load it as a code<br/>
            if no initialization code was found on any of the ROM disks, then it switches to general disks<br/>
            in file systems, the BIOS searches for the "/init.lua" file and tries to interpret it as the operating system startup code<br/>
            when the BIOS manages to find and load the initialization code, it runs it through the <a class="hyper" href="./process.html">process</a> library<br/>
            the disk from which the operating system starts is passed to the executable code as an argument so that it knows which disk to read its files from.<br/>
            please note that if the load is carried out from a ROM disk, then if it was possible to interpret it as a filesystem,<br/>
            then the filesystem will be passed, and if not (the ROM disk was read as a table and the code was taken from the "init" key), then the ROM disk itself<br/>
            when the BIOS finds the startup code, it first tries to load it as encrypted using the <a class="hyper" href="./enlua.html">enlua</a> library, and if this fails, it loads the code as normal.
        </p>

        <br/>
        <h2>env</h2>
        <p class="text">
            the BIOS loads the initialization code through the <a class="hyper" href="./process.html">process</a> library,<br/>
            which allows you to use all the callbacks as in the SComputers computer itself and run scripts from SComputers in this way<br/>
            however, it overrides the behavior of some standard functions, and if you need to access the original functions,<br/>
            it provides you with access to the "biosenv" table, which contains the functions of SComputers itself that are not affected by the BIOS<br/>
            <p class="text">list of redefined functions:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><span>reboot - redefined by the process library. it only restarts your code, but it does not restart the computer and, as a result, the BIOS</span></li>

        <h1>Operating System</h1>
        <h2>description</h2>
        <p class="text">
            the scriptableOS operating system provides a set of applications and libraries, a graphical and console interface<br/>
            scriptableOS uses the <a class="hyper" href="./vfs.html">vfs</a> library to implement a virtual file system with the ability to mount disks<br/>
            scriptableOS redefines the "require" function so that it can be used both to load system libraries and to load mod libraries<br/>
            please note that inside scriptableOS, functions such as setCode/getCode and setData/getData work for your application and not for the computer or OS, just as it is done in the BIOS<br/>
            if you want to access untouched functions inside the system environment, use "systemenv" and if you want to access computer functions, use "biosenv"<br/>
